🎓 Fundraiser Story: Help Me Pursue My Master’s Dream and Build a Better Future

Hello everyone,
My name is Pintu Kumar Sharma, and I come from a humble background in Bihar. I have always believed that education is the most powerful way to change one’s life — not just for oneself but for the family and community as well.
After years of hard work and dedication, I am grateful to have secured admission into Noida International University to pursue my Master’s in M.Tech. This program is a big step toward my dream of becoming a researcher and contributing to society meaningfully.
Unfortunately, due to financial challenges, I am unable to arrange the funds required for my tuition, accommodation, and study materials. My family’s income is modest, and we are already struggling to meet essential expenses. Despite my best efforts to apply for scholarships and part-time work, the total cost still exceeds what we can afford.
I am reaching out with a humble request for your kind support. Every small contribution will take me one step closer to my dream of completing my master’s degree and using that education to uplift not just my family, but others who come from similar circumstances.
Your generosity will directly help cover:
Tuition and academic fees
Books and learning materials
Accommodation and basic living expenses
Please consider supporting my education journey — your help means more than words can express. Even sharing this campaign with your network would make a huge difference.
Thank you for believing in me and giving me hope to continue my education. 🙏

With gratitude,
Pintu Kumar Sharma
